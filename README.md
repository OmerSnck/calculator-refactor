Trying to do this project provided to better understand the seperation of concerns. It is supposed to be 3 different type of javascript file: listener.js, logic.js. and handler.js and also HTML and CSS. Each one implements a single user story, and each one is organized the same way. By this way i created 5 branches as same names. 

I used Html, CSS and Java Script to prepare this calculator. And also i learned to isolate and integrate the Javascript code in an HTML document.

Exercises helped so much to understand.
